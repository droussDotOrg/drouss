    <strong style="color:#06F">Characteristics and conditions of wearing a veil in Islamic Law or Charia</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question :</span></strong></p>
<p>
    Charia has established conditions to put a veil for women and they are:
</p>
<p>
    1/ cover the entire body leaving only the face and the hands
</p>
<p>
    2/ put no see-through clothes for completely hiding the body
</p>
<p>
    3/ put no figure-hugging garment
</p>
<p>
    4/ put no clothes designated for men
</p>
<p>
    5/ put no clothes designated for kalirates (infidels)
</p>
<p>
    6/ put no clothes which draws attention (by its style or color)
</p>
<p>
    Islam is not a legislation that prohibits or allows a particular action; it is a lifestyle that denounces the problems, dilemmas and evils while
    prescribing solutions, foresights and remedies, here it is dealt with the relationship between men and women.
</p>
<p>
    Allah revealed two verses dealing with the subject of chastity and dress of women without forgetting the man.
</p>
<p>
    - Verse 31 of Surate<strong> <em>Nur</em></strong>:
    <em>
        "And tell the Muslim women to hold part of their looks and guard their private parts and not display their finery except what appears in and they fold
        their scarves over their bosoms (...)."
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    - Verse 59 of Surate<strong> Ahzab</strong>:
    <em>
        "Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and Muslim women to draw on them a part of their coats, they will be quickly recognized and not molested.
        Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. "
    </em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    These two verses are complementary: the first deals with the subject of modesty and chastity taking into account the importance of dress; the second deals
    with the subject of the respect and protection while also taking into account the visibility.
</p>
<p>
    In verse 31 of Surate <strong><em>The Light</em></strong>, Allah - <em>Subhaanahu wa Tahanlaa </em>- commanded Muslim women to fulfill their Islamic
    identity by the modesty that is symbolized in this verse through the turning down a portion of their gaze beyond the limits of modesty. He also prescribed
    for them, praised be He, to be chaste covering the whole body (considered intimate part) except hands and face that are not part of their finery, in the
    opinion of the majority of clerics.
