    Purity of the water, clothes, location reserved and allowed for praying

 

Question :

Whoever prays confides the secrets of their heart to their Lord. They must therefore prepare this act by ablution through purification by washing if the latter is mandatory. Ablution and purification water will not mixed with pure water of a legal impurity; they will not use water with a color (or taste or smell) that has been altered by an impure or pure foreign element. Exception is made for water that color is altered by the earth that contains it. This is the case of water or muddy saline land and other similar (1). Water from the sky, water wells, water sources and the water of the sea are good pure and purifying. The water that color is altered by a pure element which is integrated is pure but cannot be used for ablution, for purification by washing or erasing the stain of impurity (2).

Water altered by the presence of an impure element is not pure. A small amount of water is made impure by the presence of a small amount of water of impure element, even if it does not result in the alteration (3).

It is recommended to use little water while performing rigorous practices of purification. To lavishly use water is an excess and a practice contrary to the Sunnah. Indeed, the Messenger of God (Anleyhi Salaatu wa-s-s-Salaam) made ablution with a mudd of water, or the weight of a ritl and a third of ritl and he made purification with a Sa 'of a capacity of four Mudds its mudd to it (4).

The purity of the place where we will pray is mandatory (5) as well as the clothes [for the faithful prayer]. It is said that this form is obligatory ( wajib) and it is come from a divine institution of Sunnas which is strengthened (mu'akkada).

It is forbidden to pray in parks where camels are gathered for the drinking trough, on the roadways, on the roof of the Sacred House of God (the Kaa'ba) in the bathroom when you are not sure of its purity, on garbage dumps, in places of slaughtering, in infidels cemeteries or in their churches. (...)

To pray, the woman should at least wear a thick, long tunic that covers the tops of her feet; she will have a veil (Hammar) to hide her hair and neck. And she will hit the ground with hands psalms, like the man in prostration.

(1) For example: sulphurous waters, those containing gypsum, alum, lime, even if we put these products intentionally.

(2) This means that it can remove the material contamination, but cannot stop the legality of that impurity contamination.

(3) However, it is admitted that the water in any quantity may be, it becomes impure by altering color, smell and taste.

However, when a small amount of water contains more than one drop of impure body, but that does not produce an alteration, you should not use it if you have other water at your disposal.

(4) It can be about 16 ounces, which would be about half a liter.

(5) That can be places that could touch the members of the faithful while praying.
