    <strong style="color:#06F">The Purification</strong></h2>
<p>
    Among the various kinds of purification, the most important is that of the body (dianaba), when necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Any adult has to purify the body whenever needed. Whoever denies this is an infidel; whoever consciously refuses without any just cause is a godless and is
    without credibility. If he does not repent, he will be thrown into the fires of hell.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reasons of purification</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The reasons of body purification are 4 types:
</p>
<p>
    1) - Consecutive ejaculation felt with great pleasure in awaking or sleeping.
</p>
<p>
    After awaking, whoever finds semen on his clothes and its flow without being conscious must do purification and must repeat all previous prayers after this
    finding.
</p>
<p>
    Whoever discovers after awaking suspicious spots on his body or his clothes must be purified. And also, he must repeat all previous prayers after this
    finding.
</p>
<p>
    2) - After sexual intercourse, both adults must purify themselves, even if there was no ejaculation.
</p>
<p>
    - In case of a major and a minor, the purification is mandatory for man.
</p>
<p>
    - If there is an adult woman, purification is not necessary if there is no secretion.
</p>
<p>
    - The purification remains meritorious for the minor in both cases.
</p>
<p>
    3) - A woman menstruating must be purified after its end, however small the amount of bleeding.
</p>
<p>
    4) - The purification is mandatory in cases of delivering, even if the latter is not accompanied with bleeding.
</p>
